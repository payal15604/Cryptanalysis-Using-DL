#Update
Used AI Tools to rectify the issues faced initially in the code.

#Update2
Will try using C Language and import the grain module (not available as an open source) using GitHub Repos


The Grain Cipher Implementation involves the encryption of data using functions of Linear Feedback Shift Registers.
It has two shift registers, LFSR and NFSR. 
It will focus on generating a keystream corresponding to the given initialization vector, key, and plain text.
